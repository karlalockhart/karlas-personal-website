		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<hr>
		
		<p>At 18, I tried out for my college Division 1 Women’s Basketball team (for those of you who don’t know division levels for college sports, Division 1 out 3 is the most competitive). Unfortunately, I didn’t make the team that year. But I did the following year…and the next 2 years after that. My perseverance paid off and from that day forward I knew Icould do anything. Once I set my mind to do something, it will happen. I am a walking Nike quote - “Just Do It</p>

		<p>I put that perseverance to work as a design professional. My background, while extensive, isn’t traditional. With degrees in both architecture and industrial design, I have over 7 years of experience and strong technical skills with knowledge in the latest advanced technologies out there such as 3D printing, Revit, Rhino and so much more.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Previously, I went back to get my professional degree in architecture. At Pratt, not only did I gathered a tremendous amount of knowledge about parametric &amp; generative design, but also, worked as a graduate assistant for the largest computer lab on campus and as a graduate teacher assistant 
		for a design studio course.</p>

		<p>In a nutshell, my passion for design is coupled with a love for sports, innovation and experimentation. I’m not the designer who wants to just design. I’m the designer who has that entrepreneurial spirit and actually wants to innovate, plan and lead a team to success. From the words of my father, “always do your best and have fun” and design is what I do best!</p>

		<p>If you’re interested in grabbing coffee and talking shop (or just want to hear about my battles on the basketball court against some of the tallest women on earth!), please send an 
		<a href="mailto:lockhakb@yahoo.com">email</a> my way.</p>
